Welcome to my blog. This whole page is generated from a simple text file.

## How to write here

You can write standard text. You can make things **bold** or *italic*.

### Adding Images
To add an image, upload it to your GitHub repository (e.g., create an `images` folder). Then link it like this:

![My Description](images/photo.jpg)

### Adding Code
If you want to share code snippets:

```javascript
console.log("Hello World");
```

## Why this setup?

1. **Configurable**: Change colors in `_config.yml`.
2. **Simple**: Just edit this `index.md` file to update your site.
3. **Fast**: GitHub Pages builds it into a static HTML file automatically.

Thanks for reading!
